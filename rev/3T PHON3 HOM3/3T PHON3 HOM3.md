[//]: # (ET has somehow nabbed a flip phone, and is communicating with his alien friends in outer space in order to (we suspect) utterly subjugate humanity. He's doing this through a weird operating system called "Android", and it has "apps"??? It's 1982, so no one has any idea what kind of newfangled technology he's using. Thankfully, you're a visitor from the future. In 2022, everyone knows how to be resourceful and reverse android applications. Find the hidden date that ET plans to conquer the world, so we can be prepared.
